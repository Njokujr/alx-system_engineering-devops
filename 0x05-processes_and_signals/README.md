# 0x05. PROCESSES AND SIGNALS

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

**General**
 What is a PID
 What is a process
 How to find a processâ€™ PID
 How to kill a process
 What is a signal
 What are the 2 signals that cannot be ignored

 # REQUIREMENTS
 **General**
    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    All your Bash script files must be executable
    Your Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0 via apt-get) without any error
    The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
    The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing.

**TASKS**
__Mandatory_Tasks__
0. What is my PID
    Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

1. List your processes
    Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.

    Requirements:

        Must show all processes, for all users, including those which might not have a TTY.
        Display in a user-oriented format.
        Show process hierarchy.

2. Show your Bash PID
    Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.

    Requirements:

        You cannot use pgrep.
        The third line of your script must be # shellcheck disable=SC2009 (for more info about ignoring shellcheck error here).

3. Show your Bash PID made easy
    Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.

    Requirements:

        You cannot use ps

4. To infinity and beyond
    Write a Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.

    Requirements:

        In between each iteration of the loop, add a sleep 2

5. Don't stop me now!
    Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

    Requirements:

        You must use kill

6. Stop me if you can
    Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

    Requirements:

        You cannot use kill or killall

7. Highlander
    Write a Bash script that displays:

        To infinity and beyond indefinitely
        With a sleep 2 in between each iteration
        I am invincible!!! when receiving a SIGTERM signal

8. Beheaded process
    Write a Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.


# ADVANCED_TASKS
9. Process and PID file
    Write a Bash script that:

        Creates the file /var/run/myscript.pid containing its PID
        Displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely
        Displays I hate the kill command when receiving a SIGTERM signal
        Displays Y U no love me?! when receiving a SIGINT signal
        Deletes the file /var/run/myscript.pid and terminates itself when receiving a SIGQUIT or SIGTERM signal

10. Manage my process
   Write a manage_my_process Bash script that:

        Indefinitely writes I am alive! to the file /tmp/my_process
        In between every I am alive! message, the program should pause for 2 seconds
        Write Bash (init) script 101-manage_my_process that manages manage_my_process. (both files need to be pushed to git).

Requirements:

    When passing the argument start:
        Starts manage_my_process
        Creates a file containing its PID in /var/run/my_process.pid
        Displays manage_my_process started
    When passing the argument stop:
        Stops manage_my_process
        Deletes the file /var/run/my_process.pid
        Displays manage_my_process stopped
    When passing the argument restart
        Stops manage_my_process
        Deletes the file /var/run/my_process.pid
        Starts manage_my_process
        Creates a file containing its PID in /var/run/my_process.pid
        Displays manage_my_process restarted
    Displays Usage: manage_my_process {start|stop|restart} if any other argument or no argument is passed 


11. Zombie
    Write a C program that creates 5 zombie processes.

Requirements:

    For every zombie process created, it displays Zombie process created, PID: ZOMBIE_PID
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    When your code is done creating the parent process and the zombies, use the function bellow
